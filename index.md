**I am a full-stack application and web developer.** My personal tagline is "I'd Rather Be Coding". I love the freedom, creativity, and instant gratification from developing an idea to crafting a solution to seeing it actually working.

And software at all levels needs access to data. I have created solutions with flat file data to hardware endpoint acquisition to personal databases and enterprise level data systems. Data keeps our world operating.

I am also into hardware. From electronics to controllers to networks and robotics. Technology in all of it's implementations is my jam.

More about me is available at my [About Me](https://dan-carroll.github.io/about/) and [Bio](https://dan-carroll.github.io/dan-carroll-bio/) pages. [Return to my home page.](https://dan-carroll.github.io/)
