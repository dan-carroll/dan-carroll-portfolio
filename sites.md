    <dt><a href="https://dan-carroll.github.io/" alt="my home page">My Home Page</a></dt>
      <dd>Created with Jekyll, which is a great static site generator. Github pages utilizes Jekyll for their Github Pages. This site was originally part of the courseware from a Github Labs class. And yes, it appears in many of my lists.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://dancarroll.pythonanywhere.com/" alt="my alternate home page"></a>My Alternate Home Page</dt>
      <dd>This site is crafted from Bottle, a WSGI micro web-framework for Python, and Bootstrap 5, a very useful framework for building responsive web sites. This site is also one of my Python projects so may show up on other lists.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://dan-carroll.github.io/graphic-design-challenge/" alt="my graphic design challenge">My Graphic Design Challenge</a></dt>
      <dd>This site was created to track and showcase my journey exploring graphic design skills. It was brought to my attention that though a may have a broad range of technical skills, graphic design was not part of my skill set. So, I challenged myself to eradicate that deficit.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://dan-carroll.github.io/danreads/" alt="my book blog">My Book Blog</a></dt>
      <dd>What is a bibliophile, read that as bookworm, to do? Some books just beg to be shared. And others, well, it is good to have a book list. Especially when you love to read so much.</dd>
